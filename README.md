A Pok√©mon encyclopedia built with Ionic + Angular using the PokeAPI to list Pok√©mon and display their details.

## üöÄ Technical Implementation

### üß© Architecture
- **Standalone components** approach (no NgModules)
- Feature-based organization
- Reactive programming with RxJS Observables
- Strict typing with dedicated interfaces

### üõ† Core Features
- Paginated Pok√©mon listing with dynamic loading
- Detailed view with multiple Pok√©mon attributes
- Responsive design (mobile-first with desktop adaptations)
- Clean navigation with Angular Router
- State management for favorites (in progress)
- Proper subscription cleanup with OnDestroy

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why OnDestroy Matters
    1. Memory Leak Prevention
        - Active Observable subscriptions maintain component references in memory
        - Without cleanup, Angular cannot garbage-collect destroyed components
    2. Performance Optimization
        - Stops unnecessary background operations after component destruction
        - Prevents duplicate subscriptions when components reinitialize
    3. Data Integrity
        - Avoids "update-after-destroy" errors when components try to modify non-existent DOM elements
        - Eliminates "Cannot read property of undefined" runtime errors
    4. Reactive Best Practices
        - The takeUntil(this.destroy$) pattern is the Angular/RxJS gold standard
        - More scalable than manual subscription tracking
